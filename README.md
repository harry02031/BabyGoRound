# BabyGoRound
BabyGoRound by team SHARE (Sam, Harry, Alice, Radha &amp; Eina) during Vanhacks 2018. A inventory system in the form of a web app(REACTJS, FIREBASE) designed to help a non-profit organization named BabyGoRound. It contains important features such as an inventory system created by Mongo database and a important client, agency, and volunteer interaction system. The app has two different dashboard views. The agency dashboard where a social worker working for the agency can see all the clients, add new clients and view other staff members or the agency profile. The client once created will be added to a clients list which then a volunteer can login to approve. The volunteer dashboard has stats listed on it to indicate the number of families helped this month, number of hours volunteered and number of items donated. The function of volunteers is that they can look up agencies, clients and manage their inventory from their dashboard.
